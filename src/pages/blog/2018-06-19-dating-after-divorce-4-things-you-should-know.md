1. First Make a list

I know it may sound crazy but manifesting what you want in your ideal person is a sure fire way to get the love you are looking for. 

Write a list (yes, on paper) of all the qualities, values and personality traits you want in another person. And get very very detailed. How would they treat your family. do they come from a good family. Do they have empathy for others. how they would best comfort you when you were low. Keep going and going and going until your hand gets tired and then go some more. 

After you are done writing the list let it go into the universe. Know you will find exactly what is on that list. 

2. Date people you normal would not date



1. Date a lot of people. 

even if you are a mushy monogamist do not go on one date and then get married. It is your job to date as many people as you can and get an idea of they type of person you really need in your life now.
