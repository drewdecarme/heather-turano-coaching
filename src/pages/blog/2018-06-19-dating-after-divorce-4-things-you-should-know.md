1. First Make a list

I know it may sound crazy but manifesting what you want in your ideal person is a sure fire way to get the love you are looking for. 

Write a list (yes, on paper) of all the qualities, values and personality traits you want in another person. And get very very detailed. How would they treat your family. do they come from a good family. Do they have empathy for others. how they would best comfort you when you were low. Keep going and going and going until your hand gets tired and then go some more. 

After you are done writing the list let it go into the universe. Know you will find exactly what is on that list. 

2. Date a lot of People

Even if you are a mushy monogamist, do not go on one date and then get married. It is your job to date as many people as you can and get an idea of they type of person you really need in your life now. It is also your job to watch this person and see who they are before you fall head over heals.

The recommendation is seriously dating at least 3 people before you settle down with the next person. This helps you get over unhealthy behaviors from your previous marriage and develop healthy patterns to build a stable foundation for your next serious  relationship.

3. Date people you normally would not date

You know that guy that you are friends with that you can talk about anything too? or that co-worker that you work so well with and can solve any problem that comes up? 

News flash those are the qualities that are most important in a lasting relationship. Not the muscles and the perfect body. Remember your Ex is your Ex for a reason. They werent right for you, so dont date them again.

Change up the type of person and you will change your pattern.
